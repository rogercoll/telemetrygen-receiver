The OpenTelemetry Telemetry Generator Receiver is a specialized OpenTelemetry receiver designed to generate metrics, logs, and traces at a user-defined throughput (in bytes per second for each signal). This receiver enables you to simulate realistic telemetry flows for testing, benchmarking, and validation purposes.

## How Telemetry Is Generated

The receiver utilizes pre-captured telemetry data from a typical OpenTelemetry Demo execution, which represents a diverse set of application scenarios and workloads. When generating telemetry, the receiver uses this base data, dynamically adjusting timestamps to match the current time. This approach ensures the generated telemetry retains the structure and content of authentic OpenTelemetry Demo data while appearing as though it were generated in real-time. The pre-captured telemetry is embedded in the receiver and can be found in [demo-data](./demo-data/).
